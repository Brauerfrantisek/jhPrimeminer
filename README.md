jhPrimeminer
============

jhPrimeminer is a optimized pool miner for primecoin.

This is my first attempt at merging rdebourbon's optimized build with deschler's linux build.

Requirements
Openssl and libgmp.

On centos I had issues, so compiled libgmp from source, and have to invoke the miner using
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib64 ./jhprimeminer .....


If you found this helpful you can support my work.
